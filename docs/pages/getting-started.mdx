import ComponentCode from '../components/ComponentCode'

## Prerequisites

Your React Native (or Expo) project must have NativeWind installed and setup. If you don't have it, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/installation).

## CLI Commands

NativeCN provides a convenient CLI to help you get started quickly:

### Installation

<ComponentCode
  language="bash"
  code="npm install @nativecn/cli"
  title="Installation Command"
/>

### init

<ComponentCode
  language="bash"
  code="npx @nativecn/cli init"
  title="Init Command"
/>

The `init` command:
- Detects whether you have NativeWind installed
- Creates a theme preset file (`nativecn-preset.js`)
- Sets up required directory structure
- Installs essential dependencies
- Creates utility functions for theming

### add

<ComponentCode
  language="bash"
  code="npx @nativecn/cli add button card input"
  title="Add Components Command"
/>

The `add` command:
- Copies component code into your project
- Automatically handles component dependencies
- Installs any required npm packages
- Creates an index file for easy importing
- Works with options like `--dir` for custom location and `--overwrite` to replace existing components

Explore the documentation to learn more about available components, theming options, and how to integrate NativeCN into your projects.
